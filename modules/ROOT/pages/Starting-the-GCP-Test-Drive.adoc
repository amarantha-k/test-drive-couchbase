= Lab - Starting the GCP Test Drive

These are step by step instruction to start the Couchbase Test Drive on
Google Cloud Platform. If you have found this manual from the Test Drive
itself you may have already completed these steps.

First off, navigate to the test drive
https://couchbase.orbitera.com/c2m/trial/1062[here].

Now check your email. It will have an email from Orbitera with a link to
confirm your Test Drive account.

Now you’re logged in on the Test Drive screen. Click Launch Test Drive.

The framework will show the launch in progress. This takes a few
minutes.

What Orbitera is doing:
* Deploying 3 nodes of Couchbase Server on 3 GCE VMs
* Setting up each node
* Creating a cluster, and adding all 3 nodes to the cluster
* Creating administrator credentials
* Deploying 1 node of Sync Gateway on a GCE VM.

When you use the full GCP Cloud Launcher, it will do all these
operations for you as well. However, you will have more control over the
deployment. You can configure details like how many nodes, what type of
VMs to use, the credentials, and more.

When complete the screen will redirect and show your cluster URL, along
with credentials. You should also receive an email with this information
stating that your test drive is ready.

This includes:

* Server Admin URL (where you’ll go in your browser to login to the Couchbase Server Console)
* Admin Credentials (how you’ll login to the Console)
* Sync Gateway Admin URL (where you’ll go in your browser to view the Sync Gateway console)

You may want to bookmark these URLs and make a note of the access
information, since you will be using it throughout the remaining labs.

Great! Now you’re all set to get started with
