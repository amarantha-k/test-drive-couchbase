= Lab - Querying with N1QL

You need to have completed
link:Logging%20into%20Couchbase.md[Logging into
Couchbase] before starting this lab.

The lab here should take approximately 20 minutes to complete.

== Objective

This lab is designed to get you familiar with the N1QL (Non
1st-Normal-Form Query Language). N1QL is a general implementation of SQL++ that is
designed to work with JSON data. If you’ve used any flavor of SQL in the
past, you should be right at home. You will learn about Query Workbench,
writing SELECT queries, basic JOINs, and data manipulate queries. At the
end of this lab, you will have a basic understanding of N1QL.

N1QL is a very rich language, so this lab will only be scratching the
surface. You are invited to check out the
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/index.html[extensive
N1QL documentation] or the
http://query.pub.couchbase.com/tutorial/#1[interactive N1QL tutorial],
once you have a handle for the basics.

== Steps

=== Query Workbench

From the Couchbase Console, click ``Query''. You will be taken to an
interactive page that allows you to enter a N1QL query, execute it, and
see the results. Try a very simple query like `+SELECT 1;+`. You can
type it in, end with a semicolon, and press ``enter'', or you can just
click the ``Execute'' button. In the ``Result'' window, you’ll see the
full response to your request. It includes fields like `+success+` and
`+metrics+`, but focus on the `+results+` field. It’s an array of JSON
documents. In this case, it’s only one document with one field (assigned
a name of `+$1+`, since you didn’t specify a name), and a value of 1.

Before doing anything more advanced, you must first understand the
basics of indexing. Indexes are the key to performance in a database.
In a traditional RDBMS, all queries that cannot be satisfied by
relevant index fail back to a full scan of the data.  In Couchbase,
this is optional and often not the approach you would use.

In a huge collection of documents, you must create an index on the
fields you want to query, otherwise the queries will not execute.

In Couchbase Server, You can optionally create an index on a bucket
that is roughly equivalent to a table scan:
`+CREATE PRIMARY INDEX def_primary on bucketname+`. Fortunately, this
index has already been created on the ``travel-sample'' bucket
automatically, along with several other indexes. Click the ``Indexes''
tab in the Couchbase Console to see what indexes exist.

image:/images/3/0302-indexes.png[Indexes]

There are several other indexes on this bucket as well. For instance, if
you examine the `+def_type+` index, you’ll see that the `+type+` field
is being indexed.

image:/images/3/0303-def-type-index.png[Index on type field]

Consider this query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT t.*
FROM `travel-sample` t
WHERE t.type = 'airline';
----

What happens when you execute that query depends on the indexes you have
(or don’t have). If I have the `+def_type+` index, then this query will
make use of that index to quickly fetch any document with a type value
of ``airline''.

If all you have is the `+def_primary+` index, then the above query will
need to scan every document in the bucket, which is significantly
slower.

If you don’t have any indexes at all, the above query will fail to
execute with an error.

Try running the above query while experimenting with adding/removing
indexes. Here are some commands you will need:

* Drop the primary index:
`+DROP INDEX \`travel-sample\`.\`def_primary\`;+`
* Drop the type index: `+DROP INDEX \`travel-sample\`.\`def_type\`;+`
* Create the primary index:
`+CREATE PRIMARY INDEX \`def_primary\` ON \`travel-sample\`+`
* Create the type index:
`+CREATE INDEX \`def_type\` ON \`travel-sample\`(\`type\`)+`

When you’re done, make sure both `+def_type+` and `+def_primary+`
indexes exist in their initial state.

=== JOIN

One feature that is somewhat unique to Couchbase Server is the ability
to `+JOIN+` documents together in a query. Currently, a value can be
joined to a document by its key.

Back to the travel-sample, here is a document with key *route_10000*.

[source,javascript]
----
 {
    "sourceairport": "TLV",
    "destinationairport": "MRS",
    "airlineid": "airline_137",
    ...
}
----

Notice that is has a field, `+airlineid+`, which contains a value
*airline_137*. The document with that key looks like:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "type": "airline",
  "name": "Air France",
  ...
}
----

There is another document with that key, so we could join these two
documents together:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT r.sourceairport, r.destinationairport, r.airlineid, a.name
FROM `travel-sample` r
JOIN `travel-sample` a ON KEYS r.airlineid
----

Notice that this query is performing a `+JOIN+` from the
``travel-sample'' bucket to itself. It is selecting every document from
``travel-sample'' and aliasing the fields from there as ``r''. It’s
joining to any document where the key matches the value of
`+airlineid+`. `+JOIN+` is an `+INNER JOIN+` by default, so this query
is implicitly limiting the set of documents returned in ``r'' by using
`+airlineid+` (which is unique to route documents).

The above query will actually take quite a while to run (because it is
using the primary index), and it will return 17000+ results. To narrow
it down further, let’s limit it to just *route_10000*.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT r.sourceairport, r.destinationairport, r.airlineid, a.name
FROM `travel-sample` r
JOIN `travel-sample` a ON KEYS r.airlineid
WHERE META(r).id = 'route_10000';
----

More on `+META+` later, but for now, running that query should return
one result.

[source,javascript]
----
"results": [
    {
        "airlineid": "airline_137",
        "destinationairport": "MRS",
        "name": "Air France",
        "sourceairport": "TLV"
    }
]
----

The `+airlineid+`, `+destinationairport+`, and `+sourceairport+` fields
all come from the route document. But the `+name+` field comes from the
airline document.

=== INSERT

With N1QL, you also get the ability to run INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
queries (and more, like
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/merge.html[MERGE]
and
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/upsert.html#topic_11_9[UPSERT]).

Let’s go through all 3 to see how they work and how they differ from SQL
that you’ve written before.

An `+INSERT+` will always be inserting into `+KEY+` and `+VALUE+`
fields. The `+VALUE+` field can be a JSON literal, or the result of a
`+SELECT+` query. Here’s an example of an `+INSERT+` with a JSON
literal:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO `travel-sample` (KEY, VALUE)
VALUES ("lab3document", { "name": "Matthew", "twitter": "@mgroves" } );
----

This will create a document with the key ``lab3document''. Now try
finding that document by its key (refer back to
link:2keyvaluedocumentstorage.md[lab 2] if you need to). You can also
use `+RETURNING+` in the query to return back the record that you just
inserted:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO `travel-sample` t (KEY, VALUE)
VALUES (UUID(), { "name": "Matthew", "twitter": "@mgroves" } )
RETURNING t.*, META(t).id;
----

The `+RETURNING+` acts like a `+SELECT+`. In the above query, I’ve given
the ``travel-sample'' bucket an alias of ``t''. In the `+RETURNING+`,
I’ve asked for t.* (the entire document) and I used `+META+` to get its
key. Since I used the `+UUID+` function to generate a unique key, the
`+RETURNING+` comes in very handy in telling me the value of the key
that was generated. Here are the results of the above `+INSERT+` query:

[source,javascript]
----
"results": [
    {
        "id": "4ecff4f1-dda0-4c9e-bbe1-3c0d95734253",
        "name": "Matthew",
        "twitter": "@mgroves"
    }
]
----

Try this for yourself in Query Workbench.

=== UPDATE

`+UPDATE+` in N1QL is used to make changes to an existing document.
Assuming you still have the ``lab3document'' from above, here’s an
example of `+UPDATE+` in action:

// TODO: update this to be in the travel sample context
[source,sql]
----
UPDATE `travel-sample`
USE KEYS "lab3document"
SET name = "Matthew Groves", shoeSize = 13;
----

With this `+UPDATE+`, I’m changing the value of the existing `+name+`
field to be my first and last name. Also note that I setting the value
of `+shoeSize+`, which previously didn’t exist in the document.

`+RETURNING+` can also be used with an `+UPDATE+`.

=== DELETE

Finally, let’s get rid of this ``lab3document'' with a `+DELETE+` query.

[source,sql]
----
DELETE FROM `travel-sample`
USE KEYS "lab3document";
----

This will delete the document with the matching key. If you use a
`+RETURNING+` with a `+DELETE+`, it will return the document that you
deleted.

=== META and other JSON tidbits

`+META+` has been mentioned a few times already, and `+UUID+` was also
mentioned. These are
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/functions.html[N1QL
functions] (of which there are many). `+UUID+` simply generates a
universally unique identifier (similar to a GUID). `+META+` is a
function that, applied to a document, returns metadata about that
document. The document key (`+id+`) is the main reason you’d use
`+META+`, but there is other information in there that might be of some
use.

Before wrapping up, there is one more basic thing about N1QL that should
be made explicit. Earlier, a ``route'' document was used as an example.
This document contains an array of objects as a field. N1QL needs a way
to address both array elements and fields within an object hierarchy.
Intuitively, you’ll use the JavaScript array `+[]+` syntax and dotted
`+.+` syntax. Here’s an example of a query that gets the first item from
the schedule array, and the `+day+` value within that item.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT t.schedule[0].day
FROM `travel-sample` t
WHERE META(t).id = "route_10000";
----

Because there are arrays and hierarchies present in JSON data, the N1QL
language has added a lot of statements, functions, and operators to
query different shapes of data. Because of this, N1QL is considered a
``superset'' of SQL.

== Conclusion

To conclude, have a look at a xref:++Querying - Flexibility Summary.adoc++[summary of the flexibility] you have seen above and learn a bit about how N1QL integrates into a wider ecosystem.
