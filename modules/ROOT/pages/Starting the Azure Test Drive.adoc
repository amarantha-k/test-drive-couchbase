== Lab - Starting the Azure Test Drive

These are step by step instruction to start the Couchbase Test Drive on
Azure. If you have found this manual from the Test Drive itself you may
have already completed these steps.

First off, navigate to the
https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/couchbase.couchbase-enterprise[Couchbase
Enterprise on Azure Marketplace]. Then click the `Test Drive' button.

You will be prompted for additional information, and you will be asked
to agree to the terms of service. Click ``Done'' to proceed.

Next, Azure will start deploying the test drive. This should only take a
few minutes.

What Azure is doing:
* Deploying 3 ``nodes'' of Couchbase Server on 3 Azure VMs
* Setting up each node
* Creating a cluster, and adding all 3 nodes to the cluster
* Creating administrator credentials
* Deploying 1 node of Sync Gateway on an Azure VM.

When you deploy for production on Azure Marketplace, it will do all
these operations for you as well. However, you will have more control
over the deployment. You can configure details like how many nodes,
what type of VMs to use, the credentials, and more.

When the test drive is done deploying, you’ll see ``Access information''
displayed.

This includes:

* Server Admin URL (where you’ll go in your browser to login to the
Couchbase Server Console)
* Admin Credentials (how you’ll login to the Console)
* Sync Gateway Admin URL (where you’ll go in your browser to view the
Sync Gateway console)

You may want to bookmark these URLs and make a note of the access
information, since you will be using it throughout the remaining labs.

Great! Now you’re all set to get started with
